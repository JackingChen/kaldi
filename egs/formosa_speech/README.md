# Welcome to the "[Formosa Speech in the Wild (FSW)](https://sites.google.com/speech.ntut.edu.tw/fsw)" Project

"Formosa Speech in the Wild (FSW)" corpus is a Large-Scale database of Real-Life/Multi-Gene/Taiwanese Spontaneous Speech Collected and Transcribed from various sources which is organozed by Yuan-Fu Liao @ National Taipei University of Technology.

Since the language habits of Taiwanese people are different from other Mandarin speakers (both accents and cultures).
The current general-purpose automatic Mandarin speech recognition solutions are not suitable for supporting Taiwanese
people's daily life.

In order to boost the development of Taiwan-specific speech recognition techniques. We  will continue to release relateed corpora and baseline recips for everyone, especially for students.

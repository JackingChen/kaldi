This is the "Formosa Speech in the Wild (FSW)" Project. FSW corpus is a Large-Scale database of Real-Life/Multi-Gene/Taiwanese Spontaneous Speech Collected and Transcribed from various sources.

Since the language habits of Taiwanese people are different from other Mandarin speakers (both accents and cultures).
The current general-purpose automatic Mandarin speech recognition solutions are not suitable for supporting Taiwanese
people's daily life.
In order to boost the development of Taiwan-specific speech recognition techniques.

We  will continue to release relateed corpora and reference recips for everyone, especially for students.

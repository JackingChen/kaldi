## Welcome to the demo recipes of the Formosa Speech in the Wild (FSW) Project

Since, the language habits of Taiwanese people are different from other Mandarin speakers (both accents and cultures). We are now running a corpus collection project "Formosa Speech in the Wild (FSW)" to boost the development of Taiwan-specific speech recognition techniques.

FSW is a Large-Scale database of Real-Life/Multi-Gene/Taiwanese Spontaneous Speech Collected and Transcribed from various sources (radio, TV, open courses, etc.). And we would like to provide a baseline recipes for new researchers/students to develop their systems easily and quickly.

This recips is based on the "NER-Trs-Vol1" corpus (107 hours speech selected from National Education Radio archive, which could be applied for "Non-Commenrical Use Only". For more details, please visit:
